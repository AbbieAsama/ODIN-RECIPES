<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper</li>
<li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
<li>½ cup water</li>
<li>½ red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic</li>
<li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
</ul>
<h1>Directions</h1>
1.Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are softened, 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.
<br>
2.Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.
<br>
3.Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
<br>
4.Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times to coat. Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.
<br>
5.Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.
<br>
6.Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.
<br>
7.Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.
<h1>Tips</h1>
If you do not have an indoor electric grill, wrap a paver brick in aluminum foil and place it on top of the chicken to keep it flat while cooking on an outdoor grill.
<br>
<br>
Soak chile peppers in chicken broth instead of water, if desired.
